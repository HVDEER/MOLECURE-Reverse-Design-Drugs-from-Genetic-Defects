# MOLECURE: Reverse-Design Drugs from Genetic Defects

**MOLECURE** is an AI-powered molecular design platform that begins with a patient's genetic variant or mutation and works backwards to suggest **personalized therapeutic molecules**. These can include:
- CRISPR-Cas target sites
- Antisense oligonucleotides
- Small molecules
- Therapeutic peptides

## Key Features
- Upload a gene mutation or genomic variant
- AI/LLM parses its pathogenic context
- Generates candidate molecular interventions
- Uses structural databases + predictive tools to match therapy to molecular dysfunction

## Goals
- Accelerate precision medicine prototyping
- Democratize drug ideation from mutation-level insights
- Make genomic variants directly actionable

## Technologies
- Python + HuggingFace Transformers
- BioPython, RDKit, PubChem API
- Gene-to-function databases (ClinVar, Ensembl, OMIM)

## Future Roadmap
- Structural docking integration
- Clinical trial match suggestions
- LLM explanation generator (“why this molecule?”)
